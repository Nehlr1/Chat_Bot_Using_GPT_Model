- `intents.json`: JSON file containing the training data and intents for the chat bot.
- `web_chatbot.py`: Python script for running the chat bot as a web application.

   ````shell
   git clone https://github.com/Nehlr1/Chat_Bot_Using_GPT_Model.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ````shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the `chatbot_v2.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions to train the chat bot and generate responses.

4. To run the chat bot as a web application, execute the `web_chatbot.py` script:
